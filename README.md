# CallaBike-DataCollect
Used to collect data from the "Deutsche Bahn" call a bike rental service.

Edit the 'ScrapeDataStart.py' to get your own data.

Based on: https://github.com/Ik4ru5/pyABike

A short analysis of my bike rides can be found [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flovv/CallaBike-DataCollect/master/docs/index.html).
